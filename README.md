# Magneto E2E Testing Project

## Objective
Automate the end-to-end (E2E) testing of the Magneto website using Selenium with the Cucumber framework. Incorporate assertions and reporting using TestNG, JUnit, and Extent Reports. Document the testing process with test cases, scenarios, a mind map, bug reports, summary reports, and a comprehensive test plan.

## Project Scope

### Framework and Tool Integration
- **Selenium** for browser automation.
- **Cucumber** for behavior-driven development (BDD) and Page Object Model (POM).
- **TestNG / JUnit** for test execution and management.
- **Extent Reports** for advanced reporting.

### Key Functional Areas to Test
- Navigation and page consistency.
- UI components validation (buttons, images, forms).
- Testing dynamic elements (dropdowns, popups, modals).
- Cross-browser and responsive compatibility.
- Core functionalities of the website.

### Testing Goals
- Validate functional and non-functional requirements.
- Identify and report bugs effectively.
- Generate detailed test reports for stakeholders.

## Project Setup and Workflow

### 1. Framework Setup
#### Environment Preparation
- Install Java, Selenium WebDriver, Maven/Gradle, and a preferred IDE (IntelliJ IDEA/STS/Eclipse).
- Add dependencies for Selenium, Cucumber, TestNG/JUnit, and Extent Reports in `pom.xml` (if using Maven).

### 2. Documentation Tasks
- **Test Plan**
- **Test Cases and Scenarios**
- **Mind Map:** Visual representation using XMind or Lucidchart.
- **Bug Reports:** Log issues using a standard template.
- **Summary Report:** Execution status, issues, resolutions, and test metrics.

### 3. Implementation Tasks
- **Feature Files:** Define BDD test cases.
- **Step Definitions:** Implement step logic using Selenium WebDriver.
- **Assertions:** Validate expected vs actual results.
- **Extent Reports:** Configure reports for logs, screenshots, and execution metrics.

### 4. Execution
- Run tests on multiple browsers for cross-browser validation.
- Use TestNG/JUnit for parameterized test runs.

## Documentation Deliverables
1. **Test Plan**
2. **Test Cases and Scenarios**
3. **Mind Map**
4. **Bug Reports**
5. **Summary Report**

## Execution and Reporting
### Execution with TestNG and JUnit
- Run tests in parallel using TestNG suites.
- Validate results with JUnit assertions.

### Extent Report Generation
- Capture logs, screenshots, and execution details.
- Customize reports with summaries and categorization.

## Evaluation Metrics
- Coverage of test cases and scenarios.
- Proper implementation of the Selenium-Cucumber framework.
- Quality and completeness of documentation.
- Effective reporting with Extent Reports and assertions.
- Successful cross-browser and responsive testing.
